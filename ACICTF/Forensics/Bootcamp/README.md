Prompt - "We found an old floppy-drive laying around and think that there may be a flag hidden on it somewhere. We managed to copy the drive image, but there doesn't appear to be any kind of filesystem on it. In fact, all of the data appears to be on the first sector of the disk."

The download was a gzip file with a file called floppy.img

Running "file" on the floppy img. shows its a DOS/MBR boot sector, so we need a program to run it

Brief Google search shows the program qemu does so let's just fire that up with the command `qemu-system-x86_64 floppy.img`

The file boots immediately with the flag on screen
