`Prompt - Raspberries are so tasty. I have to have more than just one!`

Another RSA problem, the key here is that there's more than just 2 factors for n, so knowing RSA rules that you can just find the product of 1 - factor for each factor in the list, and use that as phi. Plug it all into our generic script and the flag pops out


`flag{there_are_a_few_extra_berries_in_this_one}`
