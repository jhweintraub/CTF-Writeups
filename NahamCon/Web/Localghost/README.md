`Prompt - BooOooOooOOoo! This spooOoOooky client-side cooOoOode sure is scary! What spoOoOoOoky secrets does he have in stooOoOoOore??`

On the page we're faced with an infinite scrolling ghost image in ascii art. Trying to stop the infinite scroll turned out to be a red herring. However, the title of the challenge `Localghost` led me to believe that maybe local referred to local storage, open the console and move to localstorage variables in scope and we find the flag

`JCTF{spoooooky_ghosts_in_storage}`
