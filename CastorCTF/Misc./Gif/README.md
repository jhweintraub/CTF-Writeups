`Prompt - A1l3N thought this was funny so we turned it into a challenge.`

When you look at the gif you see a bunch of numbers flash by, when we open up the gif frame by frame we can ull the numbers out

`15 13 7 19 15 6 21 14 14 25 12 15 12`

it's not decimal so we try A1Z26 cipher and we get the phrase `omgsofunnylol`

wrap it in the flag

`castorsCTF{omgsofunnylol}`
