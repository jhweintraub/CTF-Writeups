`Prompt - sylv3on_ was visiting cybercastors island and thought it'd be funny to bury the flag.txt. Can you help us DIG it out?`

Run `dig -t TXT cybercastors.com` on the flag cause the capital DIG tells us that's the command and -t flag cause we want the text record to be returned and out pops the flag
