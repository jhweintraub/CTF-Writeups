---Key 1---
check website - check robots.txt - 2 files - key-1-of-3.txt (flag) and fsocity.dic (a dictionary file)

--Key 2---
Directory scan shows a wordpress back end

Go to /wp-admin and put in the normal checks (root, admin, etc) and we all get the message "ERROR: Invalid username. Lost your password?"

Because the name of the box is Mr. Robot I tried the username "elliot" (the character from the show)
and a random password and random password and get a diff. message "ERROR: The password you entered for the username elliot is incorrect"

So now we know the user is elliot, and we have a dic. so let's use hydra to attack it
