# SharkyCTF Post-Mortem

----
## What was it?
see [SharkyCTF](https://ctfd.sharkyctf.xyz/)

> We are a team of 4 students in cybersecurity from ENSIBS, an engineering school in Vannes, France. This is a project we wanted to create from a little while, and ENSIBS gave us ressources and the time to work on it. We really hope you will like it.

I competed as Just me and my friend Stephan. Given that we competed against teams of up to 10 people, i'm happy with how we did. The goal is always just to learn
