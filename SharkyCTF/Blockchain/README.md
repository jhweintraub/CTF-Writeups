## Explanation
These challenges were very fun. They involve finding the hole in an Ethereum Smart Contract with the Solidity language. For Every challenge we're given the code, and a contract address on the Ropsten Testnet. The contract is instantiated with a certain value, and when the value of it reaches zero then the web page will give us the flag. I've included the code for solidity and the writeup. 

Having worked for a ethereum start up in the past I really enjoyed these challenges that would have been difficult otherwise.
